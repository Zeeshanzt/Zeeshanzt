Hi, I'm @Zeeshanzt! I'm a passionate individual with a strong interest in Embedded Systems and Machine Learning. Currently, I'm exploring the use of Esp32 for IoT purposes and leveraging its capabilities to communicate data obtained through a camera to a cloud platform and web. I'm also working on creating a Web App and Management System for inventory management, showcasing my skills in full-stack development.

I'm excited to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge in these fields. As a final year student, I'm focused on my project, which involves developing an inventory management system using drones. With this project, I aim to utilize my skills and knowledge in Embedded Systems and Machine Learning to create innovative solutions for modern-day inventory management.

If you're interested in collaborating on this project or have any ideas to share, I'd be more than happy to hear from you! Check out my Github profile for more information on my skills and projects.
