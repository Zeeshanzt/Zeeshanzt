Hey there, I'm Zeeshan Hussain - a Machine Learning Engineer. My passion lies in the fields of Embedded Systems and Machine Learning, and I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies to push the boundaries of what's possible.

In my free time, I love working on personal projects that allow me to apply my skills and explore new ideas. One of my recent projects involved building an Autonomous UAV for Warehouse Inventory Management. I implemented ORB SLAM for autonomous movement, equipped the drone with a camera capable of 3D mapping the environment as well as scanning QR and bar codes, and used Django to build a robust web application.

I have a strong foundation in Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Keras, Scikit-Learn, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ROS, Gazebo, OpenCV, FreeRTOS, Verilog, FPGA, MATLAB, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Vision, Point Clouds, Video Analytics and Visual SLAM.

If you're interested in learning more about my work or collaborating on a project, feel free to check out my Github profile. Let's create something innovative and make a positive impact on the world!
